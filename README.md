# Samurai Email Discovery
SED is a email discovery framework created 100% in BASH that grabs emails via google dork, company name, or domain name.

# Requirements
-apt-install lynx

Possibly more features such as an OSINT options, and credential reuse discovery but it does the trick for now.
Enjoy,
